<p>Nudgr is a small macOS utility for inspecting Nudge configuration files and the SOFA feed, with tools to simulate and control Nudge behavior during testing.</p>

## What it does

- Loads a Nudge JSON file and shows basic parsing info and required OS targets.
- Fetches the SOFA feed and highlights:
  - when an update must be installed
  - when Nudge will open
- Supports simulation of date and OS version to test different scenarios.
- Launches the Nudge command and can kill the Nudge process.
- Includes utilities to install or uninstall Nudge by pulling the latest release from GitHub.
- Provides quick shortcuts to generate commands for logging Nudge actions.

## Typical workflow

1. Select a Nudge JSON file.
2. Review parsed config details and SOFA summaries.
3. Adjust simulated date/OS version if needed.
4. Run or kill Nudge from the toolbar controls.

## What it's not

- Nudgr is **not** a JSON / MDM payload validator. It's simply a viewer, that lets you easily test & simulate different scenarios without having to remember all the command line shortcuts. 

## Notes

- SOFA data may be served from the system HTTP cache when offline; the UI shows a warning if a cached response is used.
